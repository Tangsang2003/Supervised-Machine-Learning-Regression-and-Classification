# Supervised Machine Learning
## Regression and Classification
This repository contains the lab files from the course one of specialization [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).\
This course was the foundation for basic Machine Learning Concepts and also basic ML models like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
### Week 1
- In week 1, basic cost function, their implementations, gradient descent its implementation, and basic Linear Regression were introduced.\
- The lab files can be found [here](/Course_1/Week_1/Lab%20Files)
### Week 2
- In week 2, topics like vectorization, feature scaling, feature engineering, scikit learn, etc were introduced.
- Also, I implemented linear regression model by myself. It can be found [here](/Course_1/Week_2/Lab%20Files/C1_W2_Linear_Regression_Self_Implementation.ipynb)
- Also, the lab files can be found [here](/Course_1/Week_2/Lab%20Files)
### Week 3
- Week 3 was the final week of the course.
- It introduced concepts of logistic regression, how it can be used in classification problems, decisiion boundaries, gradient descent for logistic regression, concepts of overfitting and regularization.
- I don't remember much of regularization. LOL.
- The lab files can be found [here](/Week_3).
